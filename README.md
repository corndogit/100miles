# 100 Miles  
A mileage tracker I made for myself to track progress during Cancer Research UK's Wheel 100 Miles in May challenge. Uses matplotlib and data from a txt file to which I added the amount of miles I skateboarded in that day.  

Over the duration of the project I added additional features, such as the mean average miles per day displayed as a plot, an estimate for when I'd complete the challenge and a total of my current progress. This was a great opportunity to learn matplotlib, which I had no prior experience with.  

I started the challenge on May 2nd 2022, finishing on May 20th 2022. I aimed to raise £150 for Cancer Research UK, and ended up raising £260 in donations plus £55 gift aid.
